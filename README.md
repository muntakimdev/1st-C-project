# 1st-C-project
This is the first project that i have been assigned with. My task is to create a program that takes numbers as input and can display, sort, update, delete and search if the user
wishes.
I created the program, but I have a lot of flows, I feel like i could have used functions but at my current level this is the best I could do.
I watched some videos about memory allocation and asked chatgpt to give me explanation about the malloc and realloc
